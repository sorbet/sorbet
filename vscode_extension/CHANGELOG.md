## 0.3.23
- Fix: Sorbet extension fails when opening a project containing Ruby code but no active configuration.

## 0.3.22

- Internal code clean-up.

## 0.3.20
- `Sorbet` status bar item shows a quick-pick drop down instead of a notification dialog when clicked.

  - Defaults to `info` and does not persist between sessions.
