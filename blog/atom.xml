        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we’re excited to celebrate six months since Sorbet’s open source release!</p>
<p>Sorbet is a fast, powerful type checker for Ruby developed by Stripe and an
ever-growing community of contributors. You can <a href="https://sorbet.run">try it online</a> or
<a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/adopting">set it up in your project</a> today. Sorbet gradually integrates into
existing Ruby projects. With Sorbet, people writing Ruby gain more confidence in
their changes and get faster feedback while iterating.</p>
<p>At this milestone, we’d like to take a look back on what’s happened since the
first public release of Sorbet, and what’s coming in the future.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’re excited to announce that Sorbet is now <a href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet">open source</a> and you can try it
today. Sorbet is a fast, powerful type checker designed for Ruby. It scales to
codebases with millions of lines of code and can be adopted incrementally.</p>
<p>We designed Sorbet to be used at Stripe, where the vast majority of our code is
written in Ruby. We’ve spent the last year and a half developing and adopting
Sorbet internally, and we’re finally confident that Sorbet is not just an
experimental, internal project—we’re ready to share Sorbet with the entire Ruby
community. In fact, we’ve had more than 30 companies beta test Sorbet and
provide feedback.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Stripe uses Ruby extensively<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. It’s the main language we use to build
the business logic behind our APIs, and our Ruby codebase is on the order of
millions of lines of code. At that scale and with our expected rapid growth rate
two things are true: 1) we need all the tooling help we can get to understand
and modify that much code, and 2) a total rewrite in a statically typed language
would be a massive undertaking.</p>
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
<p>With that in mind, in October 2017 a small team of engineers conceived of
building Sorbet, a gradual static type system for Ruby. Static type systems look
for certain classes of potential errors without running your code. A gradual
static type system allows you to gradually add static typing, leaving some parts
of your code purely dynamically typed. Other examples of gradual static type
systems that have been added onto existing dynamically typed languages are
<a href="https://flow.org/">Flow</a> and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> for Javascript, and <a href="https://hacklang.org/">Hack</a> for PHP. In this post, we’d
like to give a brief update about what we’ve been working on, and where we’re
going next.</p>
