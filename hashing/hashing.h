 * Contains logic pertaining to producing NameHashes for files, which are used in LSP mode to:
 * - Determine if a file change can be typechecked incrementally or not.
 * - Determine if a file contains a reference to a particular identifier (fast filter for _find references_).
 *
 * However, this file is not just used in the LSP package! `realmain` invokes hashing when the `--store-state` argument
 * is passed so that it can serialize file contents and their hashes to disk. This is really important for the payload
 * files embedded in Sorbet itself. As a result, this package is standalone from //main/lsp.
