# typed: __STDLIB_INTERNAL

# `ARGF` is a stream designed for use in scripts that process files given as
# command-line arguments or passed in via STDIN.
#
# The arguments passed to your script are stored in the `ARGV`
# [`Array`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/Array.html), one argument per
# element. `ARGF` assumes that any arguments that aren't filenames have been
# removed from `ARGV`. For example:
#
# ```
# $ ruby argf.rb --verbose file1 file2
#
# ARGV  #=> ["--verbose", "file1", "file2"]
# option = ARGV.shift #=> "--verbose"
# ARGV  #=> ["file1", "file2"]
# ```
#
# You can now use `ARGF` to work with a concatenation of each of these named
# files. For instance, `ARGF.read` will return the contents of *file1* followed
# by the contents of *file2*.
#
# After a file in `ARGV` has been read `ARGF` removes it from the
# [`Array`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/Array.html). Thus, after all
# files have been read `ARGV` will be empty.
#
# You can manipulate `ARGV` yourself to control what `ARGF` operates on. If you
# remove a file from `ARGV`, it is ignored by `ARGF`; if you add files to
# `ARGV`, they are treated as if they were named on the command line. For
# example:
#
# ```ruby
# ARGV.replace ["file1"]
# ARGF.readlines # Returns the contents of file1 as an Array
# ARGV           #=> []
# ARGV.replace ["file2", "file3"]
# ARGF.read      # Returns the contents of file2 and file3
# ```
#
# If `ARGV` is empty, `ARGF` acts as if it contained STDIN, i.e. the data piped
# to your script. For example:
#
# ```
# $ echo "glark" | ruby -e 'p ARGF.read'
# "glark\n"
# ```

  # called without arguments the contents of this pseudo file are returned in
  # their entirety.
  #
  # _length_ must be a non-negative integer or +nil+.
  #
  # If _length_ is a positive integer, +read+ tries to read
  # _length_ bytes without any conversion (binary mode).
  # It returns +nil+ if an EOF is encountered before anything can be read.
  # Fewer than _length_ bytes are returned if an EOF is encountered during
  # the read.
  # In the case of an integer _length_, the resulting string is always
  # in ASCII-8BIT encoding.
  #
  # If _length_ is omitted or is +nil+, it reads until EOF
  # and the encoding conversion is applied, if applicable.
  # A string is returned even if EOF is encountered before any data is read.
  #
  # If _length_ is zero, it returns an empty string (<code>""</code>).
  #
  # If the optional _outbuf_ argument is present,
  # it must reference a String, which will receive the data.
  # The _outbuf_ will contain only the received data after the method call
  # even if it is not empty at the beginning.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #    $ echo "small" > small.txt

  # ARGF.external_encoding   -> encoding
  #
  # Returns the external encoding for files read from +ARGF+ as an +Encoding+
  # object. The external encoding is the encoding of the text as stored in a
  # file. Contrast with +ARGF.internal_encoding+, which is the encoding used
  # to represent this text within Ruby.
  #
  # To set the external encoding use +ARGF.set_encoding+.
  #

  def self.external_encoding()
    #This is a stub, used for indexing
  end
  # ARGF.internal_encoding   -> encoding
  #
  # Returns the internal encoding for strings read from +ARGF+ as an
  # +Encoding+ object.
  #
  # If +ARGF.set_encoding+ has been called with two encoding names, the second
  # is returned. Otherwise, if +Encoding.default_external+ has been set, that
  # value is returned. Failing that, if a default external encoding was
  # specified on the command-line, that value is used. If the encoding is
  # unknown, +nil+ is returned.

  # ARGF.set_encoding("ext_enc:int_enc", opt) -> ARGF
  # ARGF.set_encoding(ext_enc, int_enc, opt)  -> ARGF
  #
  # If single argument is specified, strings read from ARGF are tagged with
  # the encoding specified.
  #
  # If two encoding names separated by a colon are given, e.g. "ascii:utf-8",
  # the read string is converted from the first encoding (external encoding)
  # to the second encoding (internal encoding), then tagged with the second
  # encoding.
  #
  # If two arguments are specified, they must be encoding objects or encoding
  # names. Again, the first specifies the external encoding; the second
  # specifies the internal encoding.
  #
  # If the external encoding and the internal encoding are specified, the
  # optional +Hash+ argument can be used to adjust the conversion process. The
  # structure of this hash is explained in the String#encode documentation.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #     ARGF.set_encoding('ascii')         # Tag the input as US-ASCII text
  #     ARGF.set_encoding(Encoding::UTF_8) # Tag the input as UTF-8 text
  #     ARGF.set_encoding('utf-8','ascii') # Transcode the input from US-ASCII
  #                                        # to UTF-8.
