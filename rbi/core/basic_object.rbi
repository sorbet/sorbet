# [`BasicObject`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/BasicObject.html) is the
# parent class of all classes in Ruby. It's an explicit blank class.
#
# [`BasicObject`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/BasicObject.html) can be
# used for creating object hierarchies independent of Ruby's object hierarchy,
# proxy objects like the
# [`Delegator`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/Delegator.html) class, or
# other uses where namespace pollution from Ruby's methods and classes must be
# avoided.
#
# To avoid polluting
# [`BasicObject`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/BasicObject.html) for
# other users an appropriately named subclass of
# [`BasicObject`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/BasicObject.html) should
# be created instead of directly modifying BasicObject:
#
# ```ruby
# class MyObjectSystem < BasicObject
# end
# ```
#
# [`BasicObject`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/BasicObject.html) does not
# include [`Kernel`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/Kernel.html) (for
# methods like `puts`) and
# [`BasicObject`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/BasicObject.html) is
# outside of the namespace of the standard library so common classes will not be
# found without using a full class path.
#
# A variety of strategies can be used to provide useful portions of the standard
# library to subclasses of
# [`BasicObject`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/BasicObject.html). A
# subclass could `include Kernel` to obtain `puts`, `exit`, etc. A custom
# Kernel-like module could be created and included or delegation can be used via
# [`method_missing`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/BasicObject.html#method-i-method_missing):
#
# ```ruby
# class MyObjectSystem < BasicObject
#   DELEGATE = [:puts, :p]
#
#   def method_missing(name, *args, &block)
#     return super unless DELEGATE.include? name
#     ::Kernel.send(name, *args, &block)
#   end
#
#   def respond_to_missing?(name, include_private = false)
#     DELEGATE.include?(name) or super
#   end
# end
# ```
#
# Access to classes and modules from the Ruby standard library can be obtained
# in a [`BasicObject`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/BasicObject.html)
# subclass by referencing the desired constant from the root like `::File` or
# `::Enumerator`. Like
# [`method_missing`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/BasicObject.html#method-i-method_missing),
# const\_missing can be used to delegate constant lookup to `Object`:
#
# ```ruby
# class MyObjectSystem < BasicObject
#   def self.const_missing(name)
#     ::Object.const_get(name)
#   end
# end
# ```
class BasicObject
  # Boolean negate.
  sig {returns(T::Boolean)}
  def !(); end

  # Returns true if two objects are not-equal, otherwise false.
  sig do
    params(
        other: BasicObject,
    )
    .returns(T::Boolean)
  end
  def !=(other); end

  # Equality --- At the
  # [`Object`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/Object.html) level, #==
  # returns `true` only if `obj` and `other` are the same object. Typically,
  # this method is overridden in descendant classes to provide class-specific
  # meaning.
  #
  # Unlike #==, the
  # [`equal?`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/BasicObject.html#method-i-equal-3F)
  # method should never be overridden by subclasses as it is used to determine
  # object identity (that is, `a.equal?(b)` if and only if `a` is the same
  # object as `b`):
  #
  # ```ruby
  # obj = "a"
  # other = obj.dup
  #
  # obj == other      #=> true
  # obj.equal? other  #=> false
  # obj.equal? obj    #=> true
  # ```
  #
  # The eql? method returns `true` if `obj` and `other` refer to the same hash
  # key. This is used by [`Hash`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/Hash.html)
  # to test members for equality. For any pair of objects where eql? returns
  # `true`, the hash value of both objects must be equal. So any subclass that
  # overrides eql? should also override hash appropriately.
  #
  # For objects of class
  # [`Object`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/Object.html), eql?  is
  # synonymous with #==. Subclasses normally continue this tradition by aliasing
  # eql? to their overridden #== method, but there are exceptions.
  # [`Numeric`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/Numeric.html) types, for
  # example, perform type conversion across #==, but not across eql?, so:
  #
  # ```ruby
  # 1 == 1.0     #=> true
  # 1.eql? 1.0   #=> false
  # ```
  sig do
    params(
        other: BasicObject,
    )
    .returns(T::Boolean)
  end
  def ==(other); end

  # Returns an integer identifier for `obj`.
  #
  # The same number will be returned on all calls to `object_id` for a given
  # object, and no two active objects will share an id.
  #
  # Note: that some objects of builtin classes are reused for optimization. This
  # is the case for immediate values and frozen string literals.
  #

  # implements +\_\_id\_\_+,
  # [`Kernel`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/Kernel.html) implements
  # `object_id`.
  #
  # Immediate values are not passed by reference but are passed by value: `nil`,
  # `true`, `false`, Fixnums, Symbols, and some Floats.
  #
  # ```ruby
  # Object.new.object_id  == Object.new.object_id  # => false
  # (21 * 2).object_id    == (21 * 2).object_id    # => true
  # "hello".object_id     == "hello".object_id     # => false
