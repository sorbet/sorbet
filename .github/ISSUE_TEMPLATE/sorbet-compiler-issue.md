<!--

The Sorbet Compiler is largely a Stripe-internal experiment as of now. The
Sorbet team makes no promises about whether or when we will respond to reported
issues in the Sorbet Compiler.

To make filling out this form faster:

1. Create a program showing the bug on https://sorbet.run
2. Find the "Examples ..." button in the top right
3. Click "Create issue with example" in the dropdown menu

This will pre-populate most of the form below.
