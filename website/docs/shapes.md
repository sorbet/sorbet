```ruby
{symbol1: Type1, symbol2: Type2}

{'string1' => Type1, 'string2' => Type2}
```

This creates a fixed hash type (also referred to as a record), which is a hash
with known keys and known types for each key. For example,
`{foo: String, bar: T.nilable(Float)}` validates that an object is a hash with
exactly those 2 keys as Ruby symbols, with `foo` being a `String` and `bar`
being a `Float` or `nil`. For example: `{foo: 'hello', bar: 3.14}`.

> **Warning**: Shape types have many known limitations, and should be considered
> an experimental feature. They may not work as expected or change without
> notice. For an alternative that plays better with static type checking, see
> [Typed Structs](tstruct.md).

```ruby
# typed: true

# Shape types work for some simple cases,
# but have many known limitations.
#
# Consider instead using T::Struct to create a
# data class which models your domain.
#

extend T::Sig

sig {params(x: {a: Integer, b: String}).void}
def foo(x)
  # Limitation! returns T.untyped!
  T.reveal_type(x[:a]) # Revealed type: `T.untyped`

  # Limitation! does not warn when key doesn't exist!
  x[:c]
end

# --- What you expect ---
foo({a: 0,  b: ''}) # ok
foo({a: '', b: 0}) # error: type mismatch
foo({}) # error: missing keys

# --- What you might not expect ---
foo({a: 0, b: '', j: nil}) # ok

# --- Mutation: the ugly ---
y = {a: 0, b: ''}
y[:a] = '' # ok (!)
```

sorbet internals note: the `underlying()` of a shape is a Hash where the key
type is the union of all keys and the value type is the union of all the values.
