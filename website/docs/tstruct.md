While Sorbet supports using Hashes and Structs, it isn't always possible to
model them statically.

The `sorbet-runtime` gem ships with an alternative to using Ruby's `Hash` or
`Struct` classes that is more well supported: `T::Struct`.

## Creating a new struct class

To use `T::Struct`, first create a new class that directly inherits from it.
Then, in the body of the class, declare the fields on the struct.

```ruby
# typed: true
require 'sorbet-runtime'

# (1) Create a new class that subclasses `T::Struct`
class MyStruct < T::Struct
  # (2) Declare fields on the struct with the `prop` and `const` DSL
  prop :foo, Integer
  const :bar, T.nilable(String)
  const :quz, Float, default: 0.5
end
```

## Creating and using an instance of a struct

After defining a struct class, create instances of the class with `new` as
usual. Then use the generated getters and setters to access the instance's
fields.

```ruby
# (1) Initialize an instance of the struct
my_struct = MyStruct.new(foo: 3)

# (2) Use the generated field getters and setters
my_struct.foo # => 3
my_struct.bar # => nil
my_struct.quz # => 0.5
my_struct.foo = 4
my_struct.foo # => 4
```

Note that:

- `new` takes in a keyword argument corresponding to each field.
- Props declared with `default` are initialized to their default values if an
  initializer is not provided.
- Props whose type is `T.nilable(...)` are initialized to `nil` if an
  initializer is not provided.
- Props declared as `const` may not be mutated, so they only have getters and
  don't have setters.

## Converting structs to other types

A particularly common case is to convert an struct to a Hash. Because this is so
common, this conversion has been built in (it still must be explicitly called):

```ruby
my_struct.serialize # => { "foo": 4, "quz": 0.5 }
```

Note that `bar` is skipped because it is `nil`.

## Structs and inheritance

Sorbet does not allow inheriting from a class which inherits from `T::Struct`.

```ruby
class S < T::Struct
  prop :foo, Integer
end

class Bad < S; end # error
```

Sorbet imposes this limitation somewhat artificially, for performance. Sorbet
generates a signature for the `initialize` method of a `T::Struct` subclass. In
order to do so, it needs to know all `prop`'s defined on the class. For
performance in large codebases, Sorbet requires that it is possible to know
which methods are defined on a class purely based on syntaxâ€”Sorbet does not
allow discovering the existence of methods based on things like what a class's
superclass is, or what methods are defined on the superclass.

One common situation where inheritance may be desired is when a parent struct
declares some common props, and children structs declare their own props.

```ruby
class Parent < T::Struct
  prop :foo, Integer
end

class ChildOne < Parent # error
  prop :bar, String
end

class ChildTwo < Parent # error
  prop :quz, Symbol
end
```

We can restructure the code to use composition instead of inheritance.

```ruby
class Common < T::Struct
  prop :foo, Integer
end

class ChildOne < T::Struct
  prop :common, Common
  prop :bar, String
end

class ChildTwo < T::Struct
  prop :common, Common
  prop :quz, Symbol
end
```

If the code absolutely must use inheritance and cannot use composition, either:

- Avoid using `T::Struct`, and instead define a normal class, with things like
  `attr_reader` and an explicit `initialize` method.

- Change the superclass from `T::Struct` to `T::InexactStruct`. Sorbet will no
  longer check the types of any arguments passed to the `initialize` method on
  the subclass. This should only be used as a last resort.
