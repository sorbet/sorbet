## Abstract

We have developed a typesystem for Ruby at Stripe with a goal of increasing
developer productivity.

Stripe has a multi-million line codebase that will continue growing in
increasing pace and we want our typechecker to provide good user experience.

This talk will cover tools and tricks that Sorbet uses to be fast.

The talk does not require any previous knowledge of Ruby and isn't Ruby specific
at all.
