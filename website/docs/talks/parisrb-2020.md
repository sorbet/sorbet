## Abstract

In June 2019, Stripe open-sourced Sorbet, a fast and powerful type checker for
Ruby and a tool that has come to be indispensable for writing Ruby code at
Stripe. We'll discuss why and how we built Sorbet, including how specific
choices and tradeoffs affected its design and adoption, as well as the
experiences we've had in adopting, using, and open-sourcing Sorbet, and where we
plan to take Sorbet from here.
