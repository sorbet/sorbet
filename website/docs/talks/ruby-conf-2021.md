## Abstract

At Stripe, “make it faster!” is one of our most requested features, but we don’t
want to have to pause work on other features to get speed. Instead, we’ve built
an ahead-of-time compiler for Ruby, powered by Sorbet and LLVM, focusing on
improving latency in Stripe’s multi-million line Ruby code base.

In this talk, we’ll cover why we built it, how it works, and share preliminary
results from compiling Stripe’s production Ruby code. It’s not quite ready for
prime time yet, but we’re interested in sharing our approach and getting early
feedback on the design.
