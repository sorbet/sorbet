## Abstract

In June we open-sourced Sorbet, a fast, powerful type checker designed for Ruby.
In the 6 months since, tons of things have improved! We've built quality editor
tools like jump-to-def and seen many contributions from a growing community.
Within Stripe, we've used Sorbet to drive code quality via measurable, concrete
indicators.

We'll share these improvements and give an update on our collaboration with Matz
and the Ruby 3 Types working group. Suitable for anyone using Ruby—no
familiarity with Sorbet needed! Come follow in the footsteps of the many
companies already using Sorbet.
