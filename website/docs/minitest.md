Sorbet has special support for type checking [minitest]-defined tests that use `describe` and `it` blocks:

[minitest]: https://github.com/minitest/minitest

minitest is a Ruby gem for writing tests that ships by default with the Ruby VM. It looks like this:

```ruby
require 'minitest/autorun'

class MyClass
  def greet = 'hello'
end

class MyTest < Minitest::Spec
  describe 'my class' do
    it 'works' do
      assert_equal('hello', MyClass.new.greet)
    end
  end
end
```

## A note on typing tests

When adopting Sorbet in a codebase, don't agonize over getting all tests to `# typed: true` at first.

Tests provide their own kind of confidence: simply running the tests confirms whether there are errors in the tests or not. In essence, most test files themselves have 100% test coverage, because by definition the tests run all the time.

By contrast, it's much higher value to prioritize adopting type checking in non-test files. Non-test files might not actually be covered by tests, having behavior that only gets invoked in production.

There is definitely value in typing test (e.g., it will [enable IDE features](lsp-typed-level.md)), but typing tests are often **harder** than typing non-test code, because of the DSLs involved in defining tests.

The rest of this doc should help once you've decided that typing tests is worth the investment.

## Spec methods

Sorbet understands various minitest spec methods. These spec methods are _syntactically_ translated to other Ruby constructs internally before type checking a file to help Sorbet understand that file's structure.

- `describe 'something' { ... }`

  `describe` blocks are translated to Ruby classes. They have access to methods defined in the enclosing class where the `describe` block is defined:

  ```ruby
  def foo; end

  describe 'my test' do
    it 'calls foo' do
      foo
    end
  end
  ```

- `it 'something' { ... }`

  `it` blocks are translated to Ruby instance methods. When inside a `describe`, they have access to the methods described inside all the enclosing `describe` blocks, and the enclosing class.

- `before { ... }` / `after { ... }`

  `before` and `after` blocks are also translated to instance methods, so they have access to instance methods defined in the enclosing context.

  **Also**, `before { ... }` blocks are given special treatment: instance variables declared inside `before` blocks behave like those [defined inside `initialize` constructors]: they are allowed to be non-nilable.

- `let(:foo) { ... }`

  `let`-defined helper methods are translated to the corresponding methods.

  ```ruby
  let(:foo) { 42 }

  it 'calls foo' do
    assert_equal(42, foo)
  end
  ```

**Note**: Sorbet only looks for spec methods at the top-level of a class body or `describe` block. This mostly matters for [table driven tests](#table-driven-tests-tests-defined-with-each), but can also matter when defining tests using project-specific test metaprogramming helpers.

## Table-driven tests: tests defined with `each`

A common pattern in certain kinds of tests is to try to run the same test over multiple values:

```ruby
def handle_val(val)
  # ...
end

VALUES.each do |val|
  it "works for #{val}" do
    handle_val(val) # ðŸ’¥ Method `handle_val` does not exist
  end
end
```

Tests written in this fashion defeat Sorbet's support minitest spec methods: Sorbet only looks for minitest spec methods at the top-level of a class body.

To type patterns like this, Sorbet requires projects to define a method called `test_each`, and rewrite the call to `each` with a call to `test_each`:

```ruby
sig do
  type_parameters(:U)
    .params(iter: T::Enumerable[T.type_parameter(:U)], blk: T.proc.params(arg0: T.type_parameter(:U)).void)
    .void
end
def self.test_each(iter, &blk)
  iter.each(&blk)
end

def handle_val(val)
  # ...
end

test_each(VALUES) do |val|
  it "works for #{val}" do
    handle_val(val) # âœ… Method exists
  end
end
```

Only other minitest spec methods can appear at the top-level of the `test_each` block.

Sorbet provides `test_each` because type-checking this in the general case is quite complicated. If you try using `my_expression.each` instead, then this will work at runtime but Sorbet might report anomalous static errors related to method and variable scoping.

`test_each` is not perfectâ€”Sorbet will only be able to infer a type for the `x` variable in the block parameter when the argument to `test_each` is **syntactically** an array, not when it is some arbitrary expression that evaluates to an array.

Sorbet also has support for iterating over `Hash` literals:

```ruby
sig do
  type_parameters(:K, :V)
    .params(
      hash: T::Hash[T.type_parameter(:K), T.type_parameter(:V)],
      blk: T.proc.params(arg0: [T.type_parameter(:K), T.type_parameter(:V)]).void
    )
    .void
end
def self.test_each_hash(hash, &blk)
  hash.each(&blk)
end

def handle_val(key, val)
  # ...
end

test_each(KEY_VAL_PAIRS) do |key, val|
  it "works for #{key}=#{val}" do
    handle_val(key, val) # âœ… Method exists
  end
end
```

For more on correct and incorrect usage, consider reading the error documentation for [error code 3507](error-reference.md#3507).

### `test_each` and `test_each_hash` definitions

These definitions can either:

- be put in a module that is mixed into (`extend`'d into) the tests that want to use them
- be put in a shared test base class that the project uses (e.g., a subclass of `Minitest::Spec`)
- be duplicated verbatim into any test that wants to use them

```ruby
sig do
  type_parameters(:U)
    .params(iter: T::Enumerable[T.type_parameter(:U)], blk: T.proc.params(arg0: T.type_parameter(:U)).void)
    .void
end
def self.test_each(iter, &blk)
  iter.each(&blk)
end

sig do
  type_parameters(:K, :V)
    .params(
      hash: T::Hash[T.type_parameter(:K), T.type_parameter(:V)],
      blk: T.proc.params(arg0: [T.type_parameter(:K), T.type_parameter(:V)]).void
    )
    .void
end
def self.test_each_hash(hash, &blk)
  hash.each(&blk)
end
```
