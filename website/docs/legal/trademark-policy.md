## TL;DR:

- Whenever you use the Sorbet trademarks, you should always do so in a way that does not mislead anyone about exactly what they are getting and from whom.
- You can use the Sorbet name in connection with content on your presentation, blog, Twitter, Facebook, etc., so long as the use does not mislead anyone into thinking that your content is Sorbet's or Stripe's official content, or endorsed by Sorbet or Stripe.
- You cannot use Sorbet's trademarks on your website in a way that suggests that your website is an official Sorbet website or that Sorbet or Stripe endorses your website.
- You can call unmodified distributions of Sorbet as Sorbet, but if you distribute a modified version of Sorbet, you should label it appropriately.
- Please do not use the Sorbet trademarks in your company name, your product names, as part of your own trademarks, or in your domain names.
- We may update this policy from time to time. The official version of this policy will always be present at: [https://sorbet.org/docs/legal/trademark-policy](/docs/legal/trademark-policy).
- If you have any questions about this policy, please reach out to us using the contact information in section 7 below.

## 1. Introduction

This document, the "Policy," outlines the Sorbet project\'s (the "Project") policy for the use of our trademarks.

Trademarks are names, logos, and designs that tell the world the source of a good or service. Protecting trademarks for an open source project is important because anyone can change the source code and incorporate the source code in their own products or projects. Thus, it's important that only the original Project uses the Project's trademarks. By limiting the use of the Project's trademarks, we help users and developers know they're getting the Project and not someone else's modified version. The trademark assures users and developers of the quality and expected features of the Project.

The sections that follow describe what trademarks are covered by this Policy, as well as uses of the trademarks that are allowed without additional permission from us. If you want to use our trademarks in ways that are not described in this Policy, please see section 7 below, "How to get further information." Any use that does not comply with this Policy or for which we have not separately provided written permission is not allowed.

This Policy is adapted in part from the [Model Trademark Guidelines](http://modeltrademarkguidelines.org/) and from the [Rust Media Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/media-guide)

## 2. Our commitment to open source principles

We want to encourage and facilitate the use of our trademarks by the community, but do so in a way that still ensures that the trademarks are meaningful as a source and quality indicator for our software and the associated goods and services and continue to embody the high reputation of the software and the community associated with it. This Policy therefore tries to strike the proper balance between: 1) our need to ensure that our trademarks remain reliable indicators of the qualities that they are meant to preserve and 2) our community members\' desire to be full participants in the Project.

## 3. Trademarks subject to the guidelines

### Sorbet trademarks

This Policy covers:

1. Our word trademarks and service marks (the \"Word Marks\"):

   SORBET

2. Our logos (the \"Logos\"):

![](/img/sorbet-logo-white-sparkles.svg)

This Policy encompasses all trademarks and service marks, whether Word Marks or Logos, which are collectively referred to as the "Marks." Some Marks may not be registered, but registration does not equal ownership of trademarks. This Policy covers our Marks whether they are registered or not.

### Trademarks not licensed under this Policy

While Stripe, Inc. ("Stripe") owns the trademarks to Sorbet, Stripe's other trademarks are not licensed under this Policy.

Please see [Stripe's Marks Usage Agreement](https://stripe.com/marks/legal) for more information about the use of Stripe's other trademarks.

## 4. Basic requirements of this Policy

Whenever you use one of the Marks, you must always do so in a way that does not mislead anyone, either directly or by omission, about exactly what they are getting and from whom.

For example, you cannot say you are distributing the Sorbet software when you\'re distributing a modified version of it, because people would be confused when they are not getting the same features and functionality they would get if they downloaded the software directly from us. You also cannot use our logo on your website in a way that suggests that your website is an official website or that the Project or Stripe endorses your website. You can, though, say you like the Sorbet software, that you participate in the Sorbet community, that you are providing an unmodified version of the Sorbet software, or that you wrote an article or blog post describing how to use the Sorbet software or reviewing the Sorbet software.

This fundamental requirement, that it is always clear to people what they are getting and from whom, is reflected throughout this Policy. It should also serve as your guide if you are not sure about how you are using the Marks.

In addition:

- You may not use or register, in whole or in part, the Marks as part of your own trademark, service mark, domain name, company name, trade name, product name or service name.
- You may not use the Marks in association with the use or distribution of software if you are also not in compliance with the copyright license for the software.
- Trademark law does not allow your use of names or trademarks that are too similar to ours. You therefore may not use an obvious variation of any of our Marks or any phonetic equivalent, foreign language equivalent, takeoff, or abbreviation for a similar or compatible product or service.
- You agree that you will not acquire any rights in the Marks and that any goodwill generated by your use of the Marks inures solely to our benefit.

## 5. Permitted uses of our Marks

Please see section 4 above, "Basic requirements of this Policy," which also apply.

#### (a) Websites

You may use the Word Marks and Logos on your webpage to show your support for the Project as long as:

- The website has branding that is easily distinguished from the Sorbet website;
- You own branding or naming is more prominent than any Marks;
- The Logos hyperlink to the Project website only;
- The site does not mislead customers into thinking that either your website, service, or product is Sorbet's or Stripe's website, service, or product; and
- The site clearly states that you are not affiliated with or endorsed by the Project.

#### (b) Publications and presentations

You can use the Word Marks in book and article titles, and the Logo in illustrations within the document, as long as the use does not suggest that we have published, endorse, or agree with your work.

#### (c<!-- -->) Distribution of unmodified source code or compiled unmodified executable code

When you redistribute an unmodified copy of our software, you are not changing the quality or nature of it. Therefore, you may retain the Word Marks and the Logos we have placed on the software to identify your redistribution \-- whether that redistribution is made by optical media, memory stick or download of unmodified source and executable code. This kind of use only applied if you are redistributing an official distribution from this Project that has not been changed in any way, or a compiled version of the unmodified source code as executable code.

#### (d) Distribution of modified code and/or corresponding modified executable code

You may use the Word Marks, but not the Logos, to truthfully describe the origin of the software that you are providing, that is, that the code you are distributing is a modification of our software. You may say, for example, that \"this software is derived from the source code for Sorbet software.\"

However, as stated in the "Basic requirements of this Policy" section above, you cannot say you are distributing the Sorbet software when you\'re distributing a modified version of it, because people would be confused when they are getting a modified version of our software which may not have the same features and functionality they would get if they downloaded the software directly from us.

#### (e) Statements about compatibility, interoperability or derivation

You may use the Word Marks, but not the Logos, to truthfully describe the relationship between your software and ours. Our Mark should be used after a verb or preposition that describes the relationship between your software and ours. So you may say, for example, "Bob\'s software for the Sorbet platform" but may not say "Bob\'s Sorbet software." Some other examples that may work for you are:

\[Your software\] works with Sorbet software

\[Your software\] uses Sorbet software

\[Your software\] is compatible with Sorbet software

\[Your software\] is powered by Sorbet software

\[Your software\] runs on Sorbet software

\[Your software\] for use with Sorbet software

If you have questions about this and/or want to get further clarification, please reach out to us using the contact information in section 7 below.

#### (f) Use of trademarks to show community affiliation in themes, skins, and personas

This section discusses the use of our Marks for software such an application themes, skins and personas. The use of our Marks on websites is discussed above in section 5(a).

You may use the Word Marks and the Logos in themes, personas, or skins for applications to show your support for the Project, provided that the use is non-commercial and the use is clearly decorative, as contrasted with a use that appears to be the branding for a website or application.

If you wish to get permission for other uses of the Word Marks and the Logos (for example for commercial use), please reach out to us using the contact information in section 7 below.

## 6. Non-permitted uses of our Marks

Please see section 4 above, "Basic requirements of this Policy," which also apply.

(a) You are not allowed to use the Marks in a software distribution that combines our software with any other software program without our permission. We would consider your software "combined" with ours if you create a single executable for both software programs, as well as if by installing our software it automatically installs yours. We would not consider your software "combined" with ours if it is on the same media but requires separate, independent action to install it.

(b) As stated in the permitted uses section above, you are not allowed to use the Marks to distribute modified versions of our software without clearly indicating it is a modification.

(c<!-- -->) You are not allowed to use the Marks as part of a domain name or subdomain.

(d) You are not allowed to use the Marks on promotional goods (e.g. hats, clothing, etc.) without getting permission from us first. See section 7 below for information on how to contact us.

(e) You are not allowed to use the Marks to title, organize, or endorse a conference or user meeting without getting permission from us first. This is not intended to restrict your ability to use the Sorbet Word Marks in presentations as allowed in section 5(b) above. See section 7 below for information on how to contact us.

## 7. How to get further information
