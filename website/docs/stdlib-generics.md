The Sorbet syntax for type annotations representing arrays, hash maps, and other
containers defined in the Ruby standard library looks different from other
[class types](class-types.md) despite the fact that Ruby uses classes to
represent these values, too. Here's the syntax Sorbet uses:

| Type                           | Example value                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `T::Array[Integer]`            | `[1, 2, 3]`                           |
| `T::Array[String]`             | `["hello", "goodbye"]`                |
| `T::Hash[Symbol, Integer]`     | `{key: 0}`                            |
| `T::Hash[String, Float]`       | `{"key" => 0.0}`                      |
| `T::Set[Integer]`              | `Set[1, 2, 3]`                        |
| `T::Range[Integer]`            | `0..10`                               |
| `T::Enumerable[Integer]`       | _interface implemented by many types_ |
| `T::Enumerator[Integer]`       | [1, 2, 3].each                        |
| `T::Enumerator::Lazy[Integer]` | [1, 2, 3].each.lazy                   |

## Why the `T::` prefix?

Sorbet uses syntax like `MyClass[Elem]` for type arguments passed to
[generic classes](generics.md). All Sorbet type annotations are backwards
compatible with normal Ruby syntax, and this is no exception. In normal Ruby,
`MyClass[Elem]` would correspond to a call to a method named `[]` defined on
`MyClass`.

When creating user-defined generic classes, the `sorbet-runtime` gem
automatically defines this method so that the type annotation syntax works at
runtime.

But for classes in the Ruby standard library that Sorbet retroactively defined
as generic classes, the `[]` method will not always be defined at runtime. One
potential option would have been to use `sorbet-runtime` to monkey patch the
standard library so that the `[]` method is defined for generic classes, but
some of these Ruby standard library classes **already** define a meaningful `[]`
method. For example:

```ruby
Array[1, 2, 3]
# => evaluates to the array `[1, 2, 3]`

Set[1, 2, 3]
# => evaluates to the set containing 1, 2, and 3

Hash[:key1, 1, :key2, 2]
# => evaluates to the hash `{key1: 1, key2: 2}`
```

To avoid clobbering any existing `[]` method on these standard library classes,
Sorbet defines classes in the `T::` namespace that mirror the names of classes
in the standard library.

> Note that this mapping is not automatic: Sorbet has special-cased each
> individual class in the table above inside Sorbet (it is not possible to use
> merely prepend `T::` to the name of any class that has been defined as a
> generic type in an [RBI file](rbi.md)).

## "Generic class without type arguments"

For backwards compatibility reasons during Sorbet's original rollout, Sorbet
sometimes allows generic classes defined in the Ruby standard library to appear
in type annotations _without_ being provided type arguments:

```ruby
# typed: true
#        ^^^^ important

T.let([], Array) # no error
```

versus:

```ruby
# typed: strict

T.let([], Array)
#         ^^^^^ error: Generic class without type arguments
```

When this happens, Sorbet defaults all missing type arguments to `T.untyped`.

This exception is made only for classes in the Ruby standard library. For all
other generic classes, Sorbet requires that a generic class is provided all of
its required type arguments, even in `# typed: false` files.

This behavior may change in the future, and we strongly discourage relying on it
intentionally.

## Generics and runtime checks

Recall that Sorbet is not only a static type checker, but also a system for
[validating types at runtime](runtime.md).

However, Sorbet completely erases _generic type arguments_ at runtime. When
Sorbet sees a signature like `T::Array[Integer]`, at runtime it will **only**
check whether an argument has class `Array`, but not whether every element of
that array is also an `Integer` at runtime.

This also means that if the element type of an array has type
[`T.untyped`](untyped.md), Sorbet will not report a static error, nor will
Sorbet report a runtime error.

```ruby
sig {params(xs: T::Array[Integer]).void}
def foo(xs); end

untyped_str_array = T::Array[T.untyped].new('first', 'second')
foo(untyped_str_array)
#   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ no static error, AND no runtime error!
```

(Also note that unlike other languages that implement generics via type erasure,
Sorbet does not insert runtime casts that preserve type safety at runtime.)

Another consequence of having erased generics is that things like this will not
work:

```ruby
sig {params(xs: T.any(T::Array[Integer], T::Array[String])).void}
def example(xs)
  if xs.is_a?(T::Array[Integer]) # error!
    # ...
  elsif xs.is_a?(T::Array[String]) # error!
    # ...
  end
end
```

Sorbet will attempt to detect cases where it looks like this is happening and
report a static error, but it cannot do so in all cases.

## Standard library generics and variance

Note that all the classes in the Ruby standard library that Sorbet knows about
are **covariant** in their generic type members. Variance is is discussed in the
docs for [Generic Classes and Methods](generics.md).

Implementing covariant classes in the Ruby standard library is a compromise. It
means that things like this typecheck:

```ruby
sig {returns(T::Array[Integer])}
def returns_ints; [1, 2, 3]; end

sig {params(xs: T::Array[T.any(Integer, String)]).void}
def takes_ints_or_strings(xs); end

xs = returns_ints
takes_ints_or_strings(xs) # no error
```

This makes it easy to get the most common Ruby usage patterns to type check
without jumping through hoops.

**However**, having things like arrays and hash maps in Ruby be covariant means
that the type checker wilfully says certain programs type check even when they
have glaring type errors. For example:

```ruby
xs = T.let([0], T::Array[Integer])
nil_xs = T.let(xs, T::Array[T.nilable(Integer)])
nil_xs[0] = nil

T.reveal_type(xs.fetch(0)) # type: Integer (!)
puts xs.fetch(0)           # => nil        (!)
```

In this example, we start with `xs` having type `T::Array[Integer]`. We then
upcast it to a `T::Array[T.nilable(Integer)]`. This is the power of
covarianceâ€”this would not have been allowed had arrays been made invariant.

Sorbet allows `nil_xs[0] = nil` because the type of `nil_xs` says that it's fine
for the array to contain `nil` values.

But that's a contradiction! `nil_xs` and `xs` are merely different names for the
same underlying storage. Later if someone were to go back and read the first
element of `xs`, Sorbet would claim that they're getting back an `Integer`, but
in fact, they'd be getting back a `nil`.

Sorbet is not the only type system to implement covariant arrays. Notably:
TypeScript uses the same approach. This decision was largely motivated by
getting as much Ruby code to typecheck when initially developing and rolling out
Sorbet on large, existing codebases.

- [Class Types](class-types.md)

  Every Ruby class and module doubles as a type in Sorbet. Class types supersede
  the notion some other languages have of "primitive" types. For example,
  `"abc"` is an instance of the `String` class, and so `"abc"` has type
  `String`.

  Types do not have to belong in the Ruby standard library to be declared as
  generic types. Read more about how to define custom generic classes and
  methods.
