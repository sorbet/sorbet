title: Non-Forcing Constants

> **Note**: This feature has been removed from Sorbet. For a mostly drop in replacement, use the following snippet, which has the same runtime behavior but will not be checked statically (like the removed version would have been):

```ruby
T::Sig::WithoutRuntime.sig { params(val: BasicObject, klass: String).returns(T::Boolean) }
def self.non_forcing_is_a?(val, klass)
  method_name = "T::NonForcingConstants.non_forcing_is_a?"
  if klass.empty?
    raise ArgumentError.new("The string given to `#{method_name}` must not be empty")
  end

  current_klass = T.let(nil, T.nilable(Module))
  current_prefix = T.let(nil, T.nilable(String))

  parts = klass.split('::')
  parts.each do |part|
    if current_klass.nil?
      # First iteration
      if part != ""
        raise ArgumentError.new("The string given to `#{method_name}` must be an absolute constant reference that starts with `::`")
      end

      current_klass = Object
      current_prefix = ''

      # if this had a :: prefix, then there's no more loading to
      # do---skip to the next one
      next
    end

    if current_klass.autoload?(part)
      # There's an autoload registered for that constant, which means it's not
      # yet loaded. `value` can't be an instance of something not yet loaded.
      return false
    end

    # Sorbet guarantees that the string is an absolutely resolved name.
    search_inheritance_chain = false
    if !current_klass.const_defined?(part, search_inheritance_chain)
      return false
    end

    current_klass = current_klass.const_get(part)
    current_prefix = "#{current_prefix}::#{part}"

    if !Module.===(current_klass)
      raise ArgumentError.new("#{current_prefix} is not a class or module")
    end
  end

  current_klass.===(val)
end
```

> **Note**: This is an advanced feature of Sorbet. It's more likely that you're looking about how Sorbet handles `is_a?` using [Flow-Sensitive Typing](flow-sensitive.md). Please read carefully before using this feature.

This is a variant of `is_a?` that doesn't force its class argument to be loaded.

```ruby
class Outer
  autoload :Nested, './expensive_file_to_load.rb'
end

# ...

def foo(x)
  if T::NonForcingConstants.non_forcing_is_a?(x, '::Outer::Nested')
    # ...
  end

  # The above can be better than this, which will cause
  # `./expensive_file_to_load.rb` to load:
  if x.is_a?(::Outer::Nested)
    # ...
  end
end
```

The idea is basically: if a constant like `::Outer::Nested` hasn't loaded (e.g., because it hasn't been referenced yet), then certainly no instances of `::Outer::Nested` can exist yet, so the instance of check will short circuit and return `false`. If `::Outer::Nested` **has** loaded, the `is_a?` check will be carried out like normal.

This method should **only** be used when there's a measurable performance benefit from using it. This method is rarely used, which means that people will not be familiar with it when they see it. This makes code harder to read and reason about. Only use this method **sparingly** and when there's proof that it speeds a certain code path up.

## Usage

The `klass` given as a string must be an absolute constant reference (starting with `::`). Even though the argument is a string, the constant that the string refers to must still exist from Sorbet's perspective of the whole codebase. This means it will be an error if there's a typo in the string or the constant is renamed in the future.

```ruby
class MyClass; end

T::NonForcingConstants.non_forcing_is_a?(
  nil,
  '::MyClas' # error: Unable to resolve constant `::MyClas`
)
```

While Sorbet can see whether the constant exists or not statically, it cannot do so at runtime (since it does not force constants). This means that `is_a?` and `non_forcing_is_a?` can have different behaviors at runtime when the constant doesn't exist, which can cause subtle bugs if misused:

```ruby
val.is_a?(::DoesntExist) # NameError (uninitialized constant DoesntExist)

T::NonForcingConstants.non_forcing_is_a?(val, '::DoesntExist') # => false
```

In this case, only Sorbet's static check that the constant in the string literal must resolve prevents this situation.
