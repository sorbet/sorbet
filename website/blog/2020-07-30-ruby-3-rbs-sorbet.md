Yesterday Square [posted an article][introducing-rbs] to their blog introducing [RBS][rbs] (Ruby Signature), a type syntax format for Ruby 3.

We'd like to take a second to speak to how RBS relates to Sorbet. The short version: Sorbet will happily incorporate RBS as a way to specify type annotations, in addition to the existing syntax Sorbet supports. Stripe still has a very strong commitment to Sorbet's continued progress and success. While the Ruby core team has been working on syntax, we've been working on features that build on top of that syntax.

With that in mind, I'd love to start a discussion of some of the finer points of what this announcement means for Ruby, and for Sorbet.

## RBI? RBS?

As [Matz announced at RubyConf 2019][rubyconf-2019], Ruby 3 plans to ship type annotations for the standard library in a particular format. We've been meeting with Matz and the Ruby core team to provide input on our experience and learn from them how they're thinking about types so that Sorbet will be ready. We're [committed][faq-migration] to supporting Ruby 3's type syntax.

In the mean time, we've kept busy. While the Ruby core team has been working on the RBS syntax over the past year, the Sorbet team has delivered tons of other features. A sampling of features that didn't exist a year ago:

- Go to Definition (Aug 2019)
- [Exhaustiveness checking](/docs/exhaustiveness) (Aug 2019)
- [Typed enums](/docs/tenum) (Nov 2019)
- Autocompletion (Nov 2019)
- Step-function improvements in IDE speed (Feb 2020, June 2020)

These features make Sorbet users more productive, empowering them to do more with Sorbet. We'll happily incorporate any other syntax the Ruby core team wants to build.

## Wait, a wholly separate file?

RBS type signatures are placed in a separate file. While Sorbet also offers inline syntax (more later), we believe that supporting type signatures in a separate file is necessary. Consider: most of the Ruby standard library is implemented in C for performance (e.g., all `Array` and `Hash` functions, and many others). There must be a way to ascribe types to these internally defined classes and methods.

Providing types for the standard library is incredibly important! In completely untyped, unannotated Ruby codebases, people who try out Sorbet for the first time find that about 25% of call sites already have static type coverage. Why? Everyday Ruby code uses the standard library abundantly, and Sorbet includes type definitions for the standard library out of the box!

Additionally, there will always be libraries that prefer not using type annotations. To integrate an untyped library into a typed Ruby codebase, there must be a place for these types to live outside of that project. In fact, we already have the [sorbet-typed] repo for this purpose.

[sorbet-typed]: https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet-typed

Thus, both Sorbet and Ruby 3 support type annotations in separate files (via RBI files and RBS files, respectively).

## What about inline type annotations?

There are people using Ruby who still prefer type annotations to live in the code itself. We've built Sorbet to cater to both groups: those who **like and don't like** type annotations benefit from Sorbet.

How? Sorbet implements a [gradual type system]. Without any type annotations, Sorbet will do its best to understand and offer feedback on your code. With type annotations exclusively in separate files, Sorbet will understand more and offer better feedback. With inline type annotations, people can tell Sorbet every little detail about their code so Sorbet can offer incredible feedback. For these people, reading the types is as valuable as reading the code itself.

[gradual type system]: /docs/gradual

Sorbet has always provided syntax for inline type annotations. Annotations aren't required by Sorbet‚Äîthey're there for the people who want to empower Sorbet to help them even more. Whether you love type annotations or not, Sorbet still provides value.

## Why are inline type annotations useful?

As we mentioned above, for those teams and projects who really want static typing, inline type annotations become essential. Types carry intent, and there are frequently places where inferring the intent could be ambiguous. Consider this snippet:

```ruby
xs = [1, 2, 3]
xs << nil

# what's the type of xs? ü§î
```

[‚Üí View on sorbet.run](https://sorbet.run/#%23%20typed%3A%20true%0A%0Axs%20%3D%20%5B1%2C%202%2C%203%5D%0Axs%20%3C%3C%20nil)

A type checker could infer one of two types here:

1. either the programmer meant for `xs` to be an array of `Integer`'s and `nil`'s (i.e., `T::Array[T.nilable(Integer)]` in Sorbet's syntax), or
2. the programmer made a mistake, and didn't intend to allow `nil`'s in `xs` (i.e., it was intended to be a `T::Array[Integer]`, and this code should report a static error).

Any static checker must assume one of these outcomes, but there are times when either might make sense. Explicit annotations resolve these ambiguities. In this case, Sorbet assumes (2) by default, but other type systems do other things. For example, Flow [assumes (1) by default][flow-example].

[flow-example]: https://flow.org/try/#0MYewdgzgLgBAHhGBeGBtAjAGhgJmwZgF0BuAKAQDoAHAVwgAsAKMGgG1YEpig

Here's how to use an inline annotation in Sorbet to explicitly declare that (1) is intended:

```ruby
xs = T.let([1, 2, 3], T::Array[T.nilable(Integer)])
xs << nil

# the type of xs is unambiguous üëå
```

## Inline type annotations must be Ruby syntax

For the time being, Matz and the Ruby core team want to experiment with type annotations without changing Ruby syntax, because that would require everyone to upgrade to a specific Ruby version to benefit. Because Sorbet values inline type annotations, we embedded a type annotation language in Ruby with no syntax changes needed:

```ruby
extend T::Sig

sig {params(strings: T::Array[String]).returns(Integer)}
def count_letters(strings)
  strings.map(&:length).sum
end
```

<a href="https://sorbet.run/#%23%20typed%3A%20true%0A%0Aextend%20T%3A%3ASig%0A%0Asig%20%7Bparams(strings%3A%20T%3A%3AArray%5BString%5D).returns(Integer)%7D%0Adef%20count_letters(strings)%0A%20%20strings.map(%26%3Alength).sum%0Aend">‚Üí View on sorbet.run</a>

Sorbet's syntax is 100% valid Ruby, which has tons of benefits!

- Syntax highlighting for type annotations already works in 100% of Ruby editors.
- There's no transpiler step required‚ÄîRuby code with Sorbet type annotations runs directly.
- Every RuboCop rule ever written works with Sorbet type annotations.
- Any Ruby IDE with Go to Definition already has Go to Definition on type annotations.
- Sorbet's RBI files are just Ruby code with empty method bodies, reusing the inline syntax.
- It's backwards compatible with all supported versions of Ruby.

The obvious downside is that there are prettier inline type annotation syntaxes that are not valid Ruby. The Ruby grammar is not so complicated that it couldn't be changed to support type annotations. But again, this syntax does so well **because** it doesn't fracture the Ruby community with incompatible syntax changes.

## Sorbet is committed to improving

At the end of the day, it's not a choice between Ruby 3 or Sorbet‚Äîyou can have both at the same time. We love that the Ruby core team is bringing types to Ruby, and we're happy to incorporate their work into Sorbet. We plan to give back too: it's likely that the initial release of RBS files for the Ruby standard library will be created by converting Sorbet's already extensive standard library annotations into the RBS format.

At the same time, we're hard at work improving Sorbet. Stripe has millions of lines of Ruby code and that number is only growing. We're nearing our [second nine] of percentage of files at `# typed: true` or above‚Äîwhich is to say, those millions of lines of Ruby use a lot of types. We have hundreds of engineers writing Ruby and using our Sorbet-powered IDE every day.

Sorbet type checks these millions of lines of Ruby code in seconds, helps prevent countless production incidents, and helps new Stripe engineers spin up fast. And it does all this today! If you want to try it out, check out the docs:

or play around with small Sorbet examples online:

Sorbet already has extensive type annotations for the Ruby standard library, thanks in large part to the nearly 200 contributors to Sorbet that you can find [on GitHub][contributors], the vast majority of whom come to Sorbet from outside of Stripe and the Sorbet team.

We're happy that the Ruby core team is focused on continually improving Ruby, because we are too. ‚ù§Ô∏è
