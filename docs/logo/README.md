## Stickers

1.  Get an image for the logo that you'd like to print onto the sticker.

    In particular, our SVGs (exported from Sketch) have been known to render
    poorly with some sticker vendors. You might want to use a PNG instead.

2.  Choose a place to order from. The places we've ordered stickers from in the past:

    - <https://stickermule.com> (recommended)

      Good quality, matte vinyl finish. Supports die cut.

    - <https://stickerapp.com>

      Good quality, gloss finish. Supports die cut.

3.  Choose a kind and size of sticker.

    - If going with die-cut, we usually go for the 2" x 2" square option. When
      cut, this will turn into about 1.9" x 1.5"

    - One thing we've done is to either pre-rotate before uploading (or ask them
      to rotate the proof after uploading), so that the Sorbet logo sits at a
      45° angle within the 2x2 square. This makes the final stickers a little
      bit taller (2.4" x 1.9")
