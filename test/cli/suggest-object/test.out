test/cli/suggest-object/suggest-object.rb:4: Method `class` does not exist on `M` https://srb.help/7003
     4 |    self.class
                 ^^^^^
  Got `T.self_type (of M)` originating from:
    test/cli/suggest-object/suggest-object.rb:3:
     3 |  def foo
          ^
  Note:
    `class` is actually defined as a method on `Kernel`. To call it,
    `include Kernel` in this module to ensure the method is always there, or
    call the method using `Kernel.class` instead.
