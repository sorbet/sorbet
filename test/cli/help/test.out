  -e <string>                   Treat <string> as if it were the contents of a Ruby file passed on 
                                the command line (default: "")
      --e-rbi <string>          Like `-e`, but treat <string> as an RBI file (default: "")
      --file <path>             Run over the contents of <path>
                                (Equivalent to passing <path> as a positional argument)
      --dir <path>              Run over all Ruby and RBI files in <path>, recursively
                                (Equivalent to passing <path> as a positional argument)
      --allowed-extension <ext>[,<ext>...]
                                Use these extensions to determine which file types Sorbet should 
                                discover inside directories. (default: .rb,.rbi)
      --ignore <pattern>        Ignores input files that contain <pattern> in their paths (relative 
                                to the input path passed to Sorbet).
                                When <pattern> starts with `/` it matches against the prefix of 
                                these relative paths; others match anywhere.
                                Matches must be against whole path segments, so `foo` matches 
                                `foo/bar.rb` and `bar/foo/baz.rb` but not `foo.rb` or 
                                `foo2/bar.rb`.
      --no-config               Do not load the content of the `sorbet/config` file.
                                Otherwise, Sorbet reads the `sorbet/config` file and treats each 
                                line as if it were passed on the command line, unless the line 
                                starts with `#`.
                                To load a <file> as if it were a config file, pass `@<file>` as a 
                                positional arg
      --typed {false,true,strict,strong,[auto]}
                                Force all code to specified strictness level, disregarding all `# 
                                typed:` sigils. For `auto`, uses the `# typed:` sigil in the file 
                                or `false` for files without a sigil. (default: auto)
      --typed-override <filepath.yaml>
                                Read <filepath.yaml> to override the strictness of individual files.
                                Contents must be a map of `<strictness>: ['path1.rb', ...]` pairs.
                                Can be used to enable type checking for certain files temporarily 
                                without having to add a comment to every file. (default: "")
