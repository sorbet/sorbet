# These cases are not great at the moment.

# We currently rely on getting a `SendResponse` back to show local variable
# completions inside argument lists, which is slightly odd because we then
# check whether the send's funLoc contains the completion position, and if it
# doesn't we set the completion prefix to "" and suggest calling methods that
# might not be in scope. We should _probably_ fix that, but at least some
# things get suggested there right now, even if it's not everything.
