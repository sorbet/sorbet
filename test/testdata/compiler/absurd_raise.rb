# It's kind of tricky to test the runtime behavior of T.absurd, because we have
# so many static checks in place to ensure that all places where `T.absurd`
# would have raised are actually static errors.
#
# One place where we *don't* currently check this is element types of
# collections (we used to do these checks in sorbet-runtime but they were too
# slow, and the compiler never compiled these element type checks).
# We're abusing that fact to sneak a value through the type checker that
# doesn't actually have the asserted type, so that the absurd fails at runtime.
