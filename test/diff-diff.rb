# This script post-processes the output of llvm-diff to work around the bug
# identified in https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=48137. This bug presents
# itself as struct types that are defined in both files getting a unique suffix
# added in the diff, indicating incorrectly that two lines differ. As an
# example, you can run the following command (on osx):
#
# > /usr/local/opt/llvm@12/bin/llvm-diff \
# >   test/testdata/compiler/hello.llo.exp \
# >   test/testdata/compiler/hello.llo.exp
#
# This will indicate that there are multiple differences despite both arguments
# being the exact same file. For example, the diff reported below differs only
# in the use of `%struct.FunctionInlineCache`, where the right entry has a
# renamed version of the same struct present.
#
#   >   %send.i = call i64 @sorbet_callFuncWithCache(%struct.FunctionInlineCache.69* noundef @ic_puts, i64 0) #6, !dbg !4
#   <   %send.i = call i64 @sorbet_callFuncWithCache(%struct.FunctionInlineCache* noundef @ic_puts, i64 0) #6, !dbg !4
