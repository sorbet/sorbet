## Environment variables

There are a number of environment variables that `sorbet-runtime` reads from to change its
behavior:

- `SORBET_RUNTIME_ENABLE_CHECKING_IN_TESTS`

  Announces to Sorbet that we are currently in a test environment, so it
  should treat any sigs which are marked `.checked(:tests)` as if they were
  just a normal sig.

  This can also be done by calling `T::Configuration.enable_checking_for_sigs_marked_checked_tests`
  but the environment variable ensures this value gets set before any sigs
  are evaluated.

- `SORBET_RUNTIME_DEFAULT_CHECKED_LEVEL`

  Configure the default checked level for a sig with no explicit `.checked`
  builder. When unset, the default checked level is `:always`.

  This can also be done by calling `T::Configuration.default_checked_level = ...`
  but the environment variable ensures this value gets set before any sigs
  are evaluated.
