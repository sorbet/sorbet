    # Constructors in any language are always a bit weird: they're called in a
    # static context, but their bodies are implemented by instance methods. So
    # a mix of the rules that apply to instance methods and class methods
    # apply.
    #
    # In languages like Java and Scala, static methods/companion object methods
    # are never inherited. (In Java it almost looks like you can inherit them,
    # because `Child.static_parent_method` works, but this method is simply
    # resolved statically to `Parent.static_parent_method`). Even though most
    # instance methods overrides have variance checking done, constructors are
    # not treated like this, because static methods are never
    # inherited/overridden, and the constructor can only ever be called
    # indirectly by way of the static method. (Note: this is only a mental
    # model--there's not actually a static method for the constructor in Java,
    # there's an `invokespecial` JVM instruction that handles this).
    #
    # But Ruby is not like Java: singleton class methods in Ruby *are*
    # inherited, unlike static methods in Java. In fact, this is similar to how
    # JavaScript works. TypeScript simply then sidesteps the issue with
    # structural typing: `typeof Parent` is not compatible with `typeof Child`
    # if their constructors are different. (In a nominal type system, simply
    # having Child descend from Parent should be the only factor in determining
    # whether those types are compatible).
    #
    # Flow has nominal subtyping for classes. When overriding (static and
    # instance) methods in a child class, the overrides must satisfy variance
    # constraints. But it still carves out an exception for constructors,
    # because then literally every class would have to have the same
    # constructor. This is simply unsound. Hack does a similar thing--static
    # method overrides are checked, but not constructors. Though what Hack
    # *does* have is a way to opt into override checking for constructors with
    # a special annotation.
    #
    # It turns out, Sorbet already has this special annotation: either
    # `abstract` or `overridable`. At time of writing, *no* static override
    # checking happens unless marked with these keywords (though at runtime, it
    # always happens). Getting the static system to parity with the runtime by
    # always checking overrides would be a great place to get to one day, but
    # for now we can take advantage of it by only doing override checks for
    # constructors if they've opted in.
    #
    # (When we get around to more widely checking overrides statically, we will
    # need to build a matching special case for constructors statically.)
    #
    # Note that this breaks with tradition: normally, constructors are not
    # allowed to be abstract. But that's kind of a side-effect of everything
    # above: in Java/Scala, singleton class methods are never abstract because
    # they're not inherited, and this extends to constructors. TypeScript
    # simply rejects `new klass()` entirely if `klass` is
    # `typeof AbstractClass`, requiring instead that you write
    # `{ new(): AbstractClass }`. We may want to consider building some
    # analogue to `T.class_of` in the future that works like this `{new():
    # ...}` type.
