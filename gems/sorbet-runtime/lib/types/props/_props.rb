  # CAUTION: This mixin is used in hundreds of classes; we want to keep its surface area as narrow
  # as possible and avoid polluting (and possibly conflicting with) the classes that use it.
  #
  # It currently has *zero* instance methods; let's try to keep it that way.
  # For ClassMethods (below), try to add things to T::Props::Decorator instead unless you are sure
  # it needs to be exposed here.

    # Define a new property. See {file:README.md} for some concrete
    #  examples.
    #
    # Defining a property defines a method with the same name as the
    # property, that returns the current value, and a `prop=` method
    # to set its value. Properties will be inherited by subclasses of
    # a document class.
    #
    # @param name [Symbol] The name of this property
    # @param cls [Class,T::Types::Base] The type of this
    #   property. If the type is itself a `Document` subclass, this
    #   property will be recursively serialized/deserialized.
    # @param rules [Hash] Options to control this property's behavior.
    # @option rules [T::Boolean,Symbol] :optional If `true`, this property
    #   is never required to be set before an instance is serialized.
    #   If `:on_load` (default), when this property is missing or nil, a
    #   new model cannot be saved, and an existing model can only be
    #   saved if the property was already missing when it was loaded.
    #   If `false`, when the property is missing/nil after deserialization, it
    #   will be set to the default value (as defined by the `default` or
    #   `factory` option) or will raise if they are not present.
    #   Deprecated: For `Model`s, if `:optional` is set to the special value
    #   `:existing`, the property can be saved as nil even if it was
    #   deserialized with a non-nil value. (Deprecated because there should
    #   never be a need for this behavior; the new behavior of non-optional
    #   properties should be sufficient.)
    # @option rules [Array] :enum An array of legal values; The
    #  property is required to take on one of those values.
    # @option rules [T::Boolean] :dont_store If true, this property will
    #   not be saved on the hash resulting from
    #   {T::Props::Serializable#serialize}
    # @option rules [Object] :ifunset A value to be returned if this
    #   property is requested but has never been set (is set to
    #   `nil`). It is applied at property-access time, and never saved
    #   back onto the object or into the database.
    #
    #   ``:ifunset`` is considered **DEPRECATED** and should not be used
    #    in new code, in favor of just setting a default value.
    # @option rules [Model, Symbol, Proc] :foreign A model class that this
    #  property is a reference to. Passing `:foreign` will define a
    #  `:"#{name}_"` method, that will load and return the
    #  corresponding foreign model.
    #
    #  A symbol can be passed to avoid load-order dependencies; It
    #  will be lazily resolved relative to the enclosing module of the
    #  defining class.
    #
    #  A callable (proc or method) can be passed to dynamically specify the
    #  foreign model. This will be passed the object instance so that other
    #  properties of the object can be used to determine the relevant model
    #  class. It should return a string/symbol class name or the foreign model
    #  class directly.
    #
    # @option rules [Object] :default A default value that will be set
    #   by `#initialize` if none is provided in the initialization
    #   hash. This will not affect objects loaded by {.from_hash}.
    # @option rules [Proc] :factory A `Proc` that will be called to
    #   generate an initial value for this prop on `#initialize`, if
    #   none is provided.
    # @option rules [T::Boolean] :immutable If true, this prop cannot be
    #   modified after an instance is created or loaded from a hash.
    # @option rules [T::Boolean] :override It is an error to redeclare a
    #   `prop` that has already been declared (including on a
    #   superclass), unless `:override` is set to `true`.
    # @option rules [Symbol, Array] :redaction A redaction directive that may
    #   be passed to Chalk::Tools::RedactionUtils.redact_with_directive to
    #   sanitize this parameter for display. Will define a
    #   `:"#{name}_redacted"` method, which will return the value in sanitized
    #   form.
