Hey there!

This script will get this project ready to use with Sorbet by creating a
sorbet/ folder for your project. It will contain:

- a config file
- a bunch of 'RBI files'

RBI stands for 'Ruby Interface'; these files define classes, methods, and
constants that exist, but which Sorbet doesn't always know about.

Heads up:

To set up your project, this script will take two potentially destructive
actions:

1.  It will require every file in your project. Specifically, every script in
    your project will be run, unless that script checks if __FILE__ == $0 (or
    if __FILE__ == $PROGRAM_NAME) before running any code.

2.  It will add a comment to the top of every file (like # typed: false or
    # typed: true, depending on how many errors were found in that file.)

Done!

This project is now set up for use with Sorbet. The sorbet/ folder should exist
and look something like this:

    sorbet/
     config                      # Default options to passed to sorbet on every run
     rbi/
         sorbet-typed/           # Community writen type definition files for your gems
         gems/                   # Autogenerated type definitions for your gems (from reflection)
         hidden-definitions/     # All definitions that exist at runtime, but Sorbet couldn't see statically
         todo.rbi                # Constants which were still missing, even after the three steps above.

Please check this whole folder into version control.

What's next?

Up to you! First things first, you'll probably want to typecheck your project:

    srb tc

Other than that, it's up to you!
We recommend skimming these docs to get a feel for how to use Sorbet:

- Gradual Type Checking (https://sorbet.org/docs/gradual)
- Enabling Static Checks (https://sorbet.org/docs/static)
- RBI Files (https://sorbet.org/docs/rbi)

If instead you want to explore your files locally, here are some things to try:

- Upgrade a file marked # typed: false to # typed: true.
  Then, run srb tc and try to fix any errors.
- Add signatures to your methods with `sig`.
  For how, read: https://sorbet.org/docs/sigs
- Check whether things that show up in the TODO RBI file actually exist in your project.
  It's possible some of these constants are typos.
- Upgrade a file marked # typed: ignore to # typed: false.
  Then, run srb tc and try to fix any errors.

Please don't hesitate to give us your feedback!
